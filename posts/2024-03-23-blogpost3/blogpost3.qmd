1. Further cleaning: we discovered that one of the rows of the `Unknown` continent, `United Nations Laissez-Passer`, contained only empty rows. This suggests that this `Country` value might have had some nonzero values for some non-H1B visa types in the original dataset, but since it has zero H1B visas given to it over all the years, we deleted this row.

2. Data exploration: [comment on data exploration here, explaining the following 3 graphs:]

```{r}
# run this if you don't have the magick package installed
# install.packages("magick")
# make sure to comment install.package out before creating gh-pages.
```

```{r}
library(magick)
image1 <- image_read('images/total_bar_stacked.png')
plot(image1)
image2 <- image_read('images/total_bar.png')
plot(image2)
image3 <- image_read('images/percent_bar_faceted.png')
plot(image3)
```
