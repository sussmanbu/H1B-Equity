Our goal is to understand the labor conditions and work opportunities available to foreign workers in the United States. This inquiry is particularly relevant to our group as we are international job seekers aiming to navigate the complexities of the U.S. labor market. We seek to analyze factors such as visa regulations, industry-specific opportunities, wage standards, and workplace rights that significantly impact foreign workers.

By gaining a comprehensive understanding of these aspects, we hope to better prepare ourselves for successful employment in the U.S. and contribute positively to the workforce.
