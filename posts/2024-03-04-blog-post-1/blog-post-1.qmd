1. The first dataset we looked at is from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website: https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub/h-1b-employer-data-hub-files

It contains 15 csv files ranging from years 2009 to 2023 with about 30,000 rows per csv file and 10 columns including the fiscal year.
Looking at the columns of this dataset, it seems it was collected to see how many H1B goes through each year with number of denials, tax id, and the city applicants in. Because this is a tabular dataset, it is possible to load in R easily and start exploration data analysis.
One challenge of working with dataset is the fact that it might not help us answer deep questions. For example, if we want to answer questions such as what companies, salary incomes(plotting salary distributions versus other features), ethnicity groups, and gender.

Note: This same dataset can be found from U.S citizenship immigration services, but someone uploaded to Kaggle.
