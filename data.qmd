This comes from the file `data.qmd`.

Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.

I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.


Initially, you will study _one dataset_ but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable.
Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.


## What makes a good data set?

* Data you are interested in and care about.
* Data where there are a lot of potential questions that you can explore.
* A data set that isn't completely cleaned already.
* Multiple sources for data that you can combine.
* Some type of time and/or location component.


## Where to keep data?


Below 50mb: In `dataset` folder

Above 50mb: In `dataset_ignore` folder. This folder will be ignored by `git` so you'll have to manually sync these files across your team.

### Sharing your data


For small datasets (<50mb), you can use the `dataset` folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.

If you create a folder named `data` this will cause problems.

For larger datasets, you'll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named `dataset-ignore`. This will be ignored by git (based off the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github's size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in `dataset-ignore` are synced across team members.

Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data.

```{r}
# run this to load the dataset from the rds
data <- readRDS(file = "dataset/cleaned_h1b_data.rds")
# your code here
head(data)
```

You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\MA415\\Final_Project\`).

You might consider using the `here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.

### Load and clean data script

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them.
This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis.
Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page.
Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files. In your data page you'll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)` wich appears as [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
  * Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
  
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Rrename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.

# Data Background
  
  Our first dataset is downloaded from the [travel.state.gov website](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/NIVDetailTables/FYs97-22_NIVDetailTable.xlsx) and stored in the `dataset` folder. The data was collected by U.S Department of State, more specifically the Bureau of Consular Affairs. 
  
  The Report of the Visa Office is an annual report providing statistical information on immigrant and non-immigrant visa issuance by consular offices, including information visa allocation in numerically limited categories. The main part of this dataset we want to focus on is the country of origin of visa recipients for H1B-type visas. Years covered range from Fiscal Year 1997 to F.Y. 2022 inclusively.

  
The original dataset comes with the following features/columns

country: origin of country

H1B: H1B approval count

FY97 - FY22: represent year 1997 till 2022

Essentially, this dataset contains information of H1B approval from year 1997 till 2022 and its originate country.


## First Dataset Background

The original dataset is in dataset directory as .xlsx file. It contains pivot tables for each year that describe various U.S travel approvals such as H1B. To transform the dataset into the current one, we did the following operation

read in excel files

filter out null values(continents, .., etc)

group country

filter out other columns and keep H1B column

create columns for each year (1977-2022)


The script to transform the dataset is in scripts directory `load_and_clean_data.R` file.

This is an example of how to load our cleaned dataset from dataset directory:
```{r}

#filename <- file.choose("cleaned_h1b_data.rds")
#print(filename)
h1b_country <- 
  read_rds('dataset/cleaned_h1b_data.rds')
```

```{r}
#changing the year to numerical values
current_names <- names(h1b_country)
print(current_names)
#names(df) <- new_names

```

The code below is to rename the columns to understandable years format.
```{r}
colnames(h1b_country) <- c('Country','Continent','1997', '1998', '1999', '2000', '2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020', '2021', '2022') 

head(h1b_country)
```

The following code shortens the dimension of our dataframe to 3 columns specially the years columns. Having many years column can make the dataset hard to analysis or explore. 
```{r}
h1b_continent <- h1b_country |>
  group_by(Continent)|>
  select(-Country)|>
  summarize(across(everything(), sum, na.rm = TRUE))

data_long <- pivot_longer(h1b_continent, cols = -Continent, names_to = "year", values_to = "count_h1b")

head(data_long)
```

```{r}
# Sample data manipulation assuming h1b_country is your dataset
h1b_country_temp <- h1b_country %>%
  select(-Continent)

# Convert the data from wide to long format
data_long_all <- pivot_longer(h1b_country_temp, cols=-Country, names_to = "year", values_to = "count_h1b")

# Filter for only recent years 2022, 2021, 2020, etc.
years_of_interest <- c("2022", "2021", "2020", "2019", "2018")
data_filtered <- data_long_all %>%
  filter(year %in% years_of_interest)

# Initialize an empty list to store the pie charts
piecharts_all <- list()

# Loop only over the filtered years
for (year_iter in years_of_interest) {
  print(year_iter)
  all_temp <- data_filtered %>% 
    filter(year == year_iter)
  
  # Select the top 5 countries based on the count
  top_countries <- all_temp %>%
    group_by(Country) %>%
    summarise(total_count = sum(count_h1b), .groups = "drop") %>%
    arrange(desc(total_count)) %>%
    slice_max(order_by = total_count, n = 5)  # Updated to use slice_max which is more explicit
  
  # Summarise the rest as 'Other'
  other_countries <- all_temp %>%
    anti_join(top_countries, by = "Country") %>%
    filter(!is.na(count_h1b)) %>%
    summarise(Country = "Other",
              total_count = sum(count_h1b), .groups = "drop")
  
  # Combine the top countries and 'Other'
  combined_data <- bind_rows(top_countries, other_countries)
  # Create pie chart
  pie_chart <- pie(combined_data$total_count, labels = combined_data$Country, main = paste("Top 5 Countries in", year_iter), col=viridis(length(combined_data$total_count)))
  
  # Store the pie chart in the list
  piecharts_all[[year_iter]] <- pie_chart
}

# Print all pie charts stored in the list
print(piecharts_all)
```

## Explaination

While this dataset tells us about the country of origin of visa recipients for H1B-type visas. We believe that dataset 3 allows us to have a deeper understanding of the recent years and employment

# Dataset 3

## Background
Since there exist many columns, we will list a few important columns.

**CASE_NUMBER**: Unique identifier assigned to each application submitted for processing to OFLC.

**CASE_STATUS**: decision on application. Once certified, employer can proceed with next steps of the visa process to get VISAs for foreign worker

**FULL_TIME_POSITION**: Y for getting fulltime and N for not getting

**TOTAL_WORKER_POSITIONS**: Total number of foreign workers requested by employers

**EMPLOYER_NAME**: Business name

**PREVAILING_WAGE**: average wage based on labor market

**WAGE_RATE_OF_PAY_FROM**: wage paid at the site

**WORKSITE_CITY**: City of the worksite

**AGENT_REPRESENTING_EMPLOYER**: employer represented by agent or attorney, Y or N

**RECEIVED_DATE**: Date the application received by OFLC


[U.S Department Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance)
We downloaded LCA Programs H-1B and merge various dataset by case number to get columns. 

The data is made available as part of a broader government initiative toward transparency and open governance. This initiative aims to make government operations more accessible and understandable to the public.

By providing access to historical and current data about immigration-related labor applications, the dataset aids in understand trends, evaluate the effectiveness of current policies, and plan future actions based on solid data.

A couple of ideas we can draw from this dataset are...

* provide insights into the labor market
* immigration trends
* impacts on the economy

The data includes information like case numbers, decision dates, and other metadata which are extracted from applications processed by the OFLC(Office of Foreign Labor Certification).
This also includes newly added fields from updated visa application forms and systems, making the data more comprehensive over time. However, this dataset did not include personal or other case details due to privacy and integrity.

Overall, this dataset is a critical resource for enhancing understanding and facilitating a data-driven approach to managing and legislating foreign labor and immigration-related activities.


## How it was collected?
Recall that the dataset was provided by OFLC(Office of Foreign Labor Certification). 

Employers who are seeking to hire foreign workers must submit various forms of applications for prevailing wage determinations, labor certifications, and labor attestations. These applications are required for different visa programs, such as H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and permanent residency applications. Our goal is focus on H-1B but not limited to explore other programs.

## Why it is worth exploring?
Because our groups are interested in the labor market in U.S specifically in foreign labors. This dataset allows us to analyze the labor market dynamics related to foreign labor in the U.S. You can track trends in wages, understand the demand for labor in specific sectors, and assess how immigration policies impact the economy. This kind of analysis is crucial for crafting informed labor and economic policies.

## Cleaning Dataset
The following steps would be describing how we load our dataset and merge additional columns.
